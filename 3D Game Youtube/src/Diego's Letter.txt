To tell you the truth when Ngawati told me you where leaving I cried and
Irais told me not to cry anymore after reading your journal entry yesterday I kinda found peace in it and
why your leaving and how it will be for you
anyways I want your phone number and address on that white piece of paper
 -.- you suck btw -.- who will I talk to now and
share everything I want to say and talk about life and how everythings
 going. who am I gonna go on adventures with
 like the museum adventure and everything. You just had one year left I
	 had one year more with my best friend and all of that
just got cut down to the last day since im going to have am careers and
leave from ccd home we wont even be able to see
each other dammit Dylan why you leaving -.- now two more weeks with no
one to talk about but your happy and your figuring
your life out so I hope you do well and good luck to you maybe you'll make
a lot of money from making games oh well I can't
stop you so I have to accept your leaving but your happy so I guess I
should be too I can't say this in person and it's easier
to type it and for you to just read it. This sucks balls losing one of my
best friends #BABE3 well i love you man you

and awesome decision for me to befriend you
